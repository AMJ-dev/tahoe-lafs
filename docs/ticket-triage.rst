Ticket Triage
=============

Ticket triage is a weekly, informal ritual that is meant to solve the problem of
tickets getting opened and then forgotten about. It is simple and keeps project
momentum going and prevents ticket cruft.

It fosters conversation around project tasks and philosophies as they relate to 
milestones.

Process
-------
- The role of Ticket Triager rotates weekly 
- The Triager needs admin status on ``Trac``
- The Triager looks at all the tickets that have been created in the last week 
    - They can use a custom query or do this as the week progresses 
    - BONUS ROUND: Dig up a stale ticket from the past
- Assign each ticket to a milestone on the Roadmap 
- The following situations merit discussion:
    - A ticket doesn't have an appropriate milestone and we should create one 
    - A ticket should probably be deleted
    - A ticket could be assigned to multiple milestones 
    - There is another question about a ticket
- These tickets will be brought to a weekly meeting (currently Tuesdays) for 
discussion 

- Ticket Triager role is also assigned at this meeting
