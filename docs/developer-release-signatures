January 3, 2021

Any of the following core Tahoe contributers may sign a release. Each
release should be signed by at least two developers. They each
independently produce a signature which are made available beside
Tahoe releases after 1.15.0

This statement is signed by the previous Tahoe release key. Any future
such statements may be signed by it OR by any two developers (for
example, to add or remove developers from the list).
