Any of the following core Tahoe contributers may sign a release. Each
release MUST be signed by at least one developer but MAY have
additional signatures. Each developer independently produces a
signature which is made available beside Tahoe releases after 1.15.0

This statement is signed by the existing Tahoe release key. Any future
such statements may be signed by it OR by any two developers (for
example, to add or remove developers from the list).
